Advanced Cross-platform Library

ACPL is a library project for providing a system-level general-purpose C++ API
as uniform as possible across different platforms while maintaining as much of a
performance advantage of each platform. This library does not and will not
include API for GUI, but does and will provide functionality for CLI and server
applications.
